    "# Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "In the insurance industry, accurately predicting insurance claims is crucial for managing risk, optimizing operational efficiency, and enhancing customer satisfaction. An insurance company wants to improve its ability to predict which customers are likely to file a claim based on various features like duration of travel, net sales, commission in value, and customer age. Accurate predictions will help the company in risk assessment, policy pricing, and fraud detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The current predictive model for insurance claims is not performing optimally, leading to missed claims (false negatives) which can be costly for the business. The primary goal is to develop a robust predictive model that maximizes recall to ensure that as many claims as possible are correctly identified. This will help in better risk management, customer trust, and regulatory compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Develop a Predictive Model: Create a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will make an insurance claim based on their travel and demographic data.\n",
    "- Maximize Recall: Focus on maximizing recall to minimize the number of false negatives, ensuring that most claims are correctly identified.\n",
    "- Handle Class Imbalance: Implement techniques such as SMOTE to deal with class imbalance, ensuring the model is effective in identifying the minority class (claims).\n",
    "- Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to predicting insurance claims to enhance model performance.\n",
    "- Threshold Optimization: Adjust the decision threshold to further improve recall, ensuring that the model is sensitive enough to catch most claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "- Improve Risk Management: By accurately predicting claims, the company can better assess risk and adjust premiums accordingly.\n",
    "- Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Ensuring that legitimate claims are not missed helps in maintaining customer trust and satisfaction.\n",
    "- Regulatory Compliance: Adhere to industry regulations by accurately identifying and processing insurance claims.\n",
    "- Optimize Operational Efficiency: Reduce the cost and effort involved in handling false positives by fine-tuning the model's threshold.\n",

    "### Steps to Achieve the Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove duplicate rows.\n",
    "- Handle missing values appropriately.\n",
    "- Remove outliers to improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the distribution of features.\n",
    "- Analyze the relationship between features and the target variable (Claim).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Develop multiple models (Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, etc.) and tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV focusing on recall.\n",
    "- Handle class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Threshold Adjustment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjust the decision threshold of the best model to maximize recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the model using metrics such as recall, precision, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "Generate a comprehensive model evaluation report."

    "- Yes Claim: For trips where a claim was made, the average duration is slightly lower at about 26 days.\n",
    "- Insight: Duration appears to be slightly lower for trips that led to a claim. However, the difference is minor, suggesting that trip duration may not significantly influence the likelihood of a claim.\n",

    "Average Net Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Claim: The average net sales for trips with no claims is around $29.98.\n",
    "- Yes Claim: The average net sales for trips with claims is higher, at $39.01.\n",
    "- Insight: This suggests that higher net sales might be associated with a higher likelihood of a claim, possibly because more expensive policies might cover more risky trips or activities that are more likely to lead to claims.\n",

    "Average Commission (in value)\n",

    "- No Claim: The average commission for no-claim trips is $3.96.\n",
    "- Yes Claim: For trips with claims, the average commission is significantly higher at $7.82.\n",
    "- Insight: Higher commissions are associated with claims, which might indicate that more comprehensive or expensive insurance plans that yield higher commissions are more likely to be associated with claims.\n",

    "\n",
    "Average Age\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Claim: The average age of customers not filing a claim is approximately 36-37 years.\n",
    "- Yes Claim: The average age for those who made a claim is slightly younger, at about 34-35 years.\n",
    "- Insight: younger travelers, on average, appear to make more claims than older travelers. This could be due to younger travelers engaging in riskier activities or perhaps traveling under circumstances more prone to requiring claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Policies that lead to claims tend to have longer durations, higher net sales, and generate more commission. This suggests that such policies are possibly more comprehensive or taken for trips perceived as riskier by the insured. Age shows a lesser but still noticeable variation, potentially pointing towards a demographic that's slightly more prone to filing claims."

    "2. Agency Type\n",

    "3. Distribution Channel\n",
    "- Online: Dominates with around 350 claims.\n",
    "- Offline: Very few claims, less than 10.\n",

    "#### Interpretation with Numerical Insights:\n",
    "- Agency: The highest number of claims come from C2B, which might indicate a higher risk or higher volume of transactions.\n",
    "- Agency Type: Airlines have nearly double the claims compared to travel agencies, which might suggest a higher frequency of incidents or claims in airline-related travels.\n",
    "- Distribution Channel: Online channels dominate in terms of claims, suggesting that users purchasing through online channels might be more prone to filing claims.\n",
    "- Product Name: Cancellation plans and basic plans have higher claims, possibly indicating higher usage or risk associated with these plans.\n",
    "- Gender: The claims are somewhat evenly distributed among the genders, with a slight edge for females.\n",
    "- Destination: KOREA has the highest claims, indicating either a higher travel frequency to Korea or more incidents requiring claims."

    "- Logistic Regression: 0.016737\n",
    "- Random Forest: 0.018555\n",
    "Precision indicates the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct. Both models show extremely low precision, meaning they have a high rate of false positives. The Random Forest model has slightly better precision than Logistic Regression.\n",

    "2. Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: 0.930556\n",
    "- Random Forest: 0.916667\n",
    "Recall measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified. Both models have very high recall, with Logistic Regression slightly outperforming Random Forest. This indicates that both models are very good at identifying actual claims, which is critical in an imbalanced dataset where we aim to capture as many positive cases as possible.\n",

    "3. F1-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: 0.032883\n",
    "- Random Forest: 0.036374\n",
    "The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. Both models have very low F1-scores due to their low precision, though Random Forest performs marginally better than Logistic Regression. This highlights the trade-off between precision and recall in imbalanced datasets."

    "Based on the results and the primary goal of maximizing recall, Logistic Regression with SMOTE is the recommended final model. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Higher Recall: Logistic Regression with SMOTE has a slightly higher recall (0.930556) compared to Random Forest with Random Under Sampler (0.916667). In the context of imbalanced datasets and predicting claims, recall is crucial because we want to identify as many actual positive cases as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision: While both models have low precision, Logistic Regression is marginally lower. However, given the emphasis on recall, this trade-off is acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Simplicity and Interpretability: Logistic Regression is simpler and more interpretable compared to Random Forest. This can be an advantage when explaining the model to stakeholders or understanding the impact of different features."

    "- The adjustment of the threshold was aimed at increasing the true positive rate or recall for class 1. While the recall remained the same, the change in threshold resulted in more false positives, slightly lowering the overall accuracy and F1-score.\n",
    "- This model prioritizes identifying class 1 at the expense of a higher false positive rate, which is evident from the high recall and low precision. - Depending on the business context, such as in fraud detection or disease screening where missing a positive case (class 1) could have serious consequences, this trade-off might be acceptable.\n",
    "- The choice to use SMOTE has helped in addressing class imbalance by improving the model's ability to detect the minority class, but it comes with the cost of reduced precision, leading to many false alarms (false positives).\n"

    "\n",
    "- onehot__Gender_Prefer not say: This feature has a significant negative impact on the likelihood of a claim.\n",
    "- onehot__Distribution Channel_Offline: This feature negatively impacts the likelihood of a claim.\n",
    "- scaler__Commision (in value) and scaler__Net Sales: These numerical features have positive coefficients, indicating that higher values for commission and net sales slightly increase the likelihood of a claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Less Impactful Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features like scaler__Age, onehot__Gender_M, and some specific product names and destinations have lower absolute importance, indicating they have a less significant impact on the model's predictions."

    "##### Business Implications:\n",
    "- Travel Agencies and Products: Specific travel agencies and product names play a crucial role in predicting claims. Identifying and possibly investigating why certain agencies and products have higher or lower claims can help in risk assessment and management.\n",
    "- Destinations: Certain destinations significantly affect the likelihood of claims. This insight can be used to tailor insurance products or adjust premiums based on destination-related risk.\n",
    "- Demographic Factors: Gender and age have less impact compared to other features but still contribute to the model. Understanding these demographics can aid in better customer profiling."
