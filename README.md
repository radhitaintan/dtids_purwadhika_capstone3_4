Travel Insurance Claim Prediction

Project Overview:

This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether customers will make travel insurance claims. Based on historical data, the model aims to assist insurance companies in assessing claim risks, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing customer satisfaction by accurately identifying potential claims.

Features

The dataset includes various features related to customers' insurance policies, such as:

Agency Type

Distribution Channels

Product Name

Duration of Travel

Destination

Sales Channels

Customer Age

Commission

Model

The project utilizes Logistic Regression with Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. The model is evaluated based on its precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on maximizing recall to ensure that actual claims are not missed.
